An web application that can be used to know the weather condition of a particular city. One can give name of a city and it will show the weather condition of that city.Along with the weather condition it shows the latitude and longitude of the city.For weather condition it shows the current temparature, maximum and minimum temparature and the wind speed.I have used weathermap api to get the weather condition and latitude and longitude of a city.
